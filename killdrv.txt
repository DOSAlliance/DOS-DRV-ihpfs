What is KillDrv?
================

KillDrv is a utility which removes a logical DOS drive.  It can be
used to remove drives created by DumbDrv.  With other types of drives,
KillDrv should be used with caution.  Some device drivers don't expect
their drives to be turned off, and so they may get confused.
