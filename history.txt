iHPFS Revision History
----------------------

1.28	Fixed version check bug that prevented iHPFS to run under Novell DOS.

1.27	Runs under OpenDOS 7.02.

	Supports up to 32 drives letters (under some versions of OpenDOS).

1.26	Fixed a problem that caused hangs with MSCDEX in DOS 7.

1.25	Fixed file search problem in DOS.

	Changes to partition scanning code.

1.24	Works with Windows 95.

	Several modifications to the partition scanning code. 

	Now supports large IDE drives on more BIOSes through the /B option.

1.23	The partition scanning code has been rewritten from scratch. Most
	notably, this should fix problems with large IDE drives.

	The /B option has been removed, at least for the time being.

	Attempts to read a file starting beyond the end of the file will now
	be handled the way applications expect.

	The driver no longer leaves a small stub in memory after an uninstall,
	except when another TSR loaded after iHPFS prevents this.

	Fixed a bug that would cause a "Divide by zero" error when a partition
	was first accessed under certain conditions.

	Directory searches now imitate the behaviour of DOS more closely.

	Fixed a bug which caused Novell DOS 7 to crash when the cache was
	activated.

1.22	Added support for Novell DOS 7.

	New /B option forces use of extended BIOS functions.

1.21	Added support for large IDE drives (>528 MB).

	Added support for DR DOS 5 and 6.

	Fixed a problem with unusually long paths. If a pathname is too long
	for DOS to handle, the directory tree is cut off at the deepest 
	possible level, and subdirectories at the last level are seen as
	inaccessible files with length zero. 

1.20	iHPFS can now handle several drives in one instance. The command
	line syntax has changed to reflect this. See the documentation
	for details.

	Free space on the iHPFS partitions is now reported.

	Access has been speeded up a bit.

	The . and .. directories no longer exist in the root directory.

	A bug with the /L option in version 1.15 would cause iHPFS to
	report that a file/directory existed when only a partial file name
	was given. This has been corrected.

1.15	Fixed a problem with crashes when running iHPFS with MSD 2.11 and
	some other programs.
	
	Should now work better with fragmented files.

1.14	A new /L option gives access to files with long filenames.

	iHPFS now returns the correct disk size.

	Removed a limitation on the number of simultaneously open files -
	this works better with Windows.

	The . and .. directories are now explicitly returned in directory
	searches, which is necessary for some programs.

1.13	Speeded up the cache a lot.

	The driver may now be uninstalled using the /U option.

	Fixed a bug with directory searches. Now works with TREE.

1.12	Added support for secondary partitions.

1.11	Fixed bugs with directory searches.

1.10	Cache added. The cache uses XMS memory.

	Handles volume labels.

	Won't run under OS/2 DOS.

1.00	First release
